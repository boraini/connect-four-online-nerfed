# Laga Coordination - Delft-Themed Connect Four
Authors: CSE 2 76, Berke Aygulhan and Mert Bora Inevi
Made as a quarterly university homework project. Hope you enjoy!
## Running
Install npm and Node.js then
```console
npm i
npm start
```
You can also theoretically specify a port by having the last command in form `npm start 3000` but using any port other than 3000 will break things so just don't.
